There are 10 system armies led by the Supreme Chancellor

Each systems army is split into 2 sector armies, each led by a jedi General

Each sector army is then split into 4 corps, each led by a jedi General and/or a clone Field Marshal

There are 80 Marshal Commanders at the start of the Clone Wars

Marshal Commanders were subordinate to a Jedi General

Each Marshal Commander was in charge of a corps

A corp is divided into 16 regiments or 4 legions

A legion would be led by a jedi General or a clone Commander

A legion is then split into four regiments

Each regiment is led by a clone Commander and maybe a jedi Commander

Each regiment is further divided into 16 companies 
Or 4 battalions that were each made up of 4 companies

A battalion would be led by a Major

A company would be led by a Captain

Each company would then be divided into 4 platoons

A platoon would be led by a Lieutenant

A platoon would then be divided up to a few dozen squads

There were roughly 10000 jedi but only a few of the higher up jedis became military commanders
